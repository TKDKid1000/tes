The Epic Server Github

This repo has multiple things. From the source code to our bot, to our projects and server goals!

Not enough for you? We have more! Here is out detailed server description:

## Fun Chat Channels
We have several chat channels. One for every topic you could think of! There are channels for memes, games, and more!
Here is a short list of what we have:
* General
* Gaming Chat
* Off Topic And Images
* Meme Posting

## Great Moderation
Our staff are dedicated to this server. They try hard to make sure *you* have a good time.
We currently have staff apps open, and are looking for new people on the team. Want to join us? Go [here](https://www.theepicserver.tk/discord).

## Awesome Events
Every week we will host either an event or a stream. Our events follow a simple principle: anyone can join, anyone can win!
If you ever want to see the events, or join one go [here](https://discord.com/channels/712966305476509726/713381467463614565).

## Super Cool Streams
When we aren't doing an event that week, we will usually do a stream. Some streams have some watcher participation, some don't.
We *do* have a reward for people watching streams though. Every time you watch or host a stream you will gain a TEStream level.
Your TEStream level doesn't do much, until you reach level 6. Level 6, or **TEStream+** gives you epic perks during streams! Who doesn't want full control!

## Epic Bots
We have a few bots on our server. [Myuu](https://top.gg/bot/438057969251254293) was one of our first, it is a fully functional pokemon game!
Our event schedulular bot is called [Apollo](https://apollo.fyi/) we are using it until our developer can make his own event schedular.
Our final public bot is [Rythm](https://rythmbot.com). It is for all of our music channels.
We also have 2 custom bots, **The Epic Bot** and RPG Bot. **The Epic Bot** was made to make using our server just a tad bit easier. RPG Bot is actually our developers custom minigame!
A wiki for **The Epic Bot** is found [here](https://github.com/TKDKid1000/tes/wiki).

## Games
We also play many *many* games on our discord. You want to suggest a game? Pop on by our [server suggestions](https://discord.com/channels/712966305476509726/720305574360907778) channel and leave us a tip!
We currently host our own minecraft server as well! You can join it on Minecraft Java Edition with the ip **mc.theepicserver.tk** or on Minecraft Bedrock Edition with the ip **mc.theepicserver.tk** Port 19132.
We will continue to host more and more games as want for them increases!
